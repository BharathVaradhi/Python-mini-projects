password-generator/README.md



A beginner-friendly random password generator using Python.  
This was one of my early tasks during my internship. I explored string handling and randomness, and yes — I used Google and online examples to learn how it’s generally done.

 What it Does:
- Asks you for a password length
- Generates a secure password with letters, digits, and symbols

Modules Used:
- 'random'
- 'string'

How to Run:
```bash
python SPG.py
