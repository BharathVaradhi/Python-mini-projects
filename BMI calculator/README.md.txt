 ~BMI-calculator/README.md



This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator I created in Python.  
As someone still learning, I used this mini project to get comfortable with `if-else` conditions and working with input/output in Python. I followed a few tutorials online for support.

What it Does:
- Takes your weight and height
- Calculates your BMI
- Tells whether you're underweight, normal, overweight, or obese

 Modules:
- Pure Python (no external libraries)

How to Run:
```bash
python BMI.py
