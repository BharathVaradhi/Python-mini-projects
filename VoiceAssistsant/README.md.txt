~Voice Assistant 

This is a basic voice assistant I built using Python as part of my internship task.  
I'm still learning Python, and this project helped me understand how voice input and output can work. I referred to online tutorials to get the hang of it.

~ What it Does:
- Listens to voice commands like "hello" or "time"
- Greets you back
- Tells the current time
- Gives basic responses to unknown commands

~Modules Used:
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech
- `speech_recognition` for voice input
- `datetime` for telling time

~How to Run:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyaudio
python VoiceAssist.py
